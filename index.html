        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Symbolism:</h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 30pt;">Rittika wants to create division amongst the girls in order to cement herself as leader. She says it herself "'the Golds and the Pales?' That’s right. We’re mortal enemies" (Prasad 103). Mel is the only competitor for leader so she goes after her one glaring "disadvantage", her pale skin. Rittika knows that Samantha and Mel are best friends, and she believes that if she can get Sam to begin to believe that Golds are better than pales then having Rittika as her leader will be a choice made without hesitation. This reflects racial division present in society today, where we see politicians often catering towards minorities with zero lack of follow-through on what they say they will improve.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Civillization and Order</h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 30pt;">The girls establish order by falling into roles and designating their home at Conch Lake. After they realize that they won’t be able to find whatever it is that threatens them “Avery foraged for fruit …  Ming assumed the role of cook … Mel was in charge of keeping us hydrated” (Prasad 119). These Roles for now appear to be keeping most everybody occupied and keeping them busy. Mel is often attempting to keep everyone in line but Rittika seems to be the only negative force in maintaining order. Rittika thinks she knows more than everyone else and often leads them blindly into dangerous situations. However they are still generally working together as a unified body and there have only been attempts to separate them through Rittika.
